### Option Simulation in Python
#### Pricing Options using Monte Carlo vs. Black Scholes
I show a number of ways to model and price options using python in[this *iPython notebook*](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kierancondon/Sandbox/blob/master/Option%20Valuation%20and%20Hedging%20in%20Python.ipynb)

- Simulation of Lognormal forward prices
- Option pricing using Monte Carlo simulation
- The Black Scholes equation
- A comparison of option hedging strategies

### How logistic regression works
I took some time to think about **logistic regression** which is useful for answering questions where the answer can be one of two possibilities, such as yes or no questions. Find the full demonstration [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kierancondon/Sandbox/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
