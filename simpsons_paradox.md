It's so easy to draw the wrong conclusion from data, it happens all the time. For me, nothing makes that more clear than Simpson's Paradox which sounds exotic but is probably very common and difficult to avoid. It is explained perfectly in <a href=\"http://vudlab.com/simpsons/\">this infographic</a>.

"Every Simpson's paradox involves at least three variables: 1) the explained 2) the observed explanatory 3) the lurking explanatory. If the effect of the observed explanatory variable on the explained variable changes directions when you account for the lurking explanatory variable, you've got a Simpson's Paradox."

It can be seen in this chart:

Although it looks like there is a negative relationship between y and x, the truth is that there is a positive relationship. This is only known when accounting for the lurking variable we can call colour. Within the blue and red categories there is a positive relationship between y and x, but it is only seen when they are pooled and separated.

How can you know if there is a lurking variable that you are not accounting for?
